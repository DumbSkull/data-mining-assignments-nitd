Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.  Python has become a common language for machine learning research and is the primary language for TensorFlow. \n","\n","Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a significant revision of the language that is not entirely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.  This course makes use of Python 3.  Furthermore, TensorFlow is not compatible with versions of Python earlier than 3. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation (PSF), manages and directs resources for Python development.
